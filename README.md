# Established Coding Conventions
* Public properties/variables in C# classes are written using PascalCase `public string FirstName {get; set;}`
 * Function calls in C# also use PascalCase `public void MoveLeft()`
* Private variables in C# classes are written using camelCase and have an underscore to start `private int _currScore;`
* Opening curly braces are placed on their own lines
```
if (condition)
{
	// code
}
```
* Indentation is 4 spaces per indentation
