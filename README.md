Description

## Established Coding Conventions
* Public properties/variables in C# classes are written using camelCase `public string firstName {get; set;}`
 * Private variables in C# classes will also start with an underscore `private int _currScore;`
* Function calls in C# use PascalCase `public void MoveLeft()`
* Opening curly braces are placed on their own lines
```
if (condition)
{
	// code
}
```
* Use 4 spaces per indentation
